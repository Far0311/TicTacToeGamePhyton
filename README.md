This repository contains a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game is designed for two players, 'X' and 'O', who take turns to input their positions on a 3x3 grid by entering numbers between 1 and 9.

**Features:**<br>
**Interactive Gameplay:** Players can input their moves, and the game will update the board accordingly.<br>
**Input Validation:** Ensures that players enter valid moves within the grid and that positions are not already occupied.<br>
**Winning Combinations:** Automatically checks for winning conditions after each move.<br>
**Tie Detection:** Detects when the board is full, indicating a tie.<br>
**Game Restart:** Players can choose to restart the game after it ends.<br>

This implementation is ideal for learning the basics of game logic, handling user input, and working with simple data structures in Python.
